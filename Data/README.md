This repository models tumor growth under immunotherapy using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It simulates interactions between tumor cells, NK cells, and CTLs, factoring in immune responses and therapeutic agents, with delays for immune activation, to optimize immunotherapy strategies for cancer treatment.
