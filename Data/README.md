## Data

This section will contain datasets used for modeling tumor-immune dynamics and evaluating the impact of immunotherapy. Currently, there is no data available, but this folder will be updated with experimental or simulated data once available. It will include data related to tumor growth, immune response, and the effects of therapeutic interventions.
