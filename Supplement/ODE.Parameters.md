# System of ODEs: Parameters and Initial Conditions

This section outlines the constants, initial conditions, and parameters used in the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for modeling the interaction between populations \( N \), \( L \), and \( T \).

## Initial Conditions
These are the starting values for the populations at time \( t = 0 \).

- **\( N_0 \) (Initial population of \( N \))**: Initial population of species \( N \) (or main population).
- **\( L_0 \) (Initial population of \( L \))**: Initial population of species \( L \).
- **\( T_0 \) (Initial population of \( T \))**: Initial population of species \( T \).

## Parameters
These constants define the rates and interactions within the system. You may need to adjust these based on literature or experimental data.

- **\( a_1 \) (Growth rate of \( N \))**: Coefficient governing the growth rate of \( N \).
- **\( b \) (Density-dependent regulation for \( N \))**: Density-dependent regulation for \( N \) (e.g., logistic growth).
- **\( a_2 \) (Mortality rate of \( N \))**: Mortality rate of species \( N \).
- **\( \alpha_1 \) (Predation or interaction rate between \( N \) and \( T \))**: Rate at which \( N \) affects \( T \) (predation, competition, etc.).
- **\( r_1 \) (Growth rate of \( L \) due to \( N \) and \( T \) interaction)**: Rate at which \( L \) grows due to interaction with \( N \) and \( T \).
- **\( r_2 \) (Growth rate of \( L \) from environmental input)**: Growth rate of \( L \) from environmental resources (e.g., light, nutrients).
- **\( I_0 \) (Initial environmental input)**: Initial level of external environmental input (e.g., nutrient availability, light intensity).
- **\( h \) (Decay rate for external input)**: Time scale for decay of external resources.
- **\( \mu \) (Decay rate of \( L \))**: Mortality rate of species \( L \).
- **\( \beta_1 \) (Effect of \( T \) on \( L \)'s growth)**: Impact of \( T \) on the growth of \( L \).
- **\( c \) (Intrinsic growth rate of \( T \))**: Intrinsic growth rate of species \( T \).
- **\( d \) (Density-dependent regulation for \( T \))**: Density-dependent regulation for species \( T \).
- **\( \alpha_2 \) (Predation or interaction rate between \( N \) and \( T \))**: Rate at which \( N \) affects \( T \) in the system.
- **\( \beta_2 \) (Effect of \( L \) on \( T \)'s growth)**: Effect of \( L \) on \( T \)'s growth.

## What to Look For in the Literature
To tailor the constants and initial conditions to a real-world system, consult the following types of studies:
- **Species-specific growth rates**: Studies that report the intrinsic growth rates of the species involved in your system \( N \), \( L \), and \( T \).
- **Carrying capacities and density dependence**: Research on population density effects and how populations are limited by available resources.
- **Interaction coefficients**: Literature on ecological interactions such as predation, competition, and mutualism, particularly how species affect each other.
- **Environmental factors**: Studies on how external resources (nutrients, light, etc.) influence species growth.
- **Mortality rates**: Studies providing mortality rates of the species involved under various environmental conditions.

By gathering this information, you will be able to fine-tune the model's parameters to reflect a real-world system or experimental setup.
