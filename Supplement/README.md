## Supplement

## ODE.parameters.md
This markdown file outlines the parameters, initial conditions, and constants used in our system of ordinary differential equations for modeling the dynamics between tumor cells (T), CTL cells (L), and natural killer cells (N). 

Provided are the following components:
- *Initial conditions* for the populations of tumor cells, CTL cells, and NK cells
- *Model parameters* such as growth rates, interaction coefficients, drug coefficients, and decay rates for tumor and immune cell populations.

This supplement helps define the mathematical framework for studying tumor-immune interactions, serving as a reference for adjusting the model according to real-world data.
