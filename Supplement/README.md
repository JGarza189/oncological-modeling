This file outlines the parameters, initial conditions, and constants used in the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for modeling the dynamics between tumor cells (T), immune cells (L), and external inputs (N). 

It provides the following key components:
- *Initial conditions* for the populations of tumor cells, immune cells, and environmental factors.
- *Model parameters* such as growth rates, interaction coefficients, and decay rates for tumor and immune cell populations.
- *Guidance for tailoring constants* based on literature and experimental data, including factors like species-specific growth rates, predation or interaction rates, and environmental influences.

This document helps define the mathematical framework for studying tumor-immune interactions, serving as a reference for adjusting the model according to experimental or real-world data.
