## Scripts

### oncology_model.m | oncology_model.mlx | oncology_model.txt

These script implement a mathematical model for tumor-immune dynamics, focusing on the interactions between tumor cells, NK cells, and CTL cells. It uses a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to simulate tumor growth, immune response, and the effects of immunotherapy. The model incorporates key parameters such as tumor growth rates, immune cell activation, and therapeutic agent effectiveness. This script serves as the core of the project's computational analysis, providing insights into how immunotherapy can influence tumor suppression and immune system activation.

NOTE: MATLAB code does not render in GitHub to be easily visualized. For a quick glance, reference the oncology.model.txt file and open either in a native text editor or your preferred source code editor.
