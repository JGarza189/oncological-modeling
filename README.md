## Overview:

This repository contains scripts, data, and supplementary material associated with a applied modeling project  at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. The project aims to develop mathematical models to investigate the impact of immunotherapy on tumor growth, using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model interactions between tumor cells, NK cells, CTLs, and therapeutic agents.

### Goals:

This study investigates the role of immunotherapy in tumor suppression, focusing on how immune responses and therapeutic strategies can influence tumor dynamics. The following objectives guide the research:

**Objective 1**: Develop a system of ODEs to represent tumor-immune interactions, including tumor growth rates, immune responses, and the effects of immunotherapy agents.

**Objective 2**: Incorporate delays in immune cell activation to provide a more realistic representation of immune-tumor dynamics.

**Objective 3**: Explore how immunotherapy can improve tumor suppression and optimize immune system activation, offering insights for future therapeutic strategies and cancer treatment improvements.
